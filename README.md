# Capstone-Project-Python-
This project is about Python related tasks. There are three dataset given -
1. Project Dataframe 
2. Employee Dataframe
3. Seniority Level Dataframe
Down to it some tasks are given like- save the all three dataframes as .csv files, in “project dataframe” there are some missing values compute these and replace it by running average , create 2 new columns firstname and lastname in place of “name” column, join all three dataframes in single, create new 5% bouns column, print all employees details whose city name contains the letter “o” in it and so on. 
To complete the task we generally use the python code - to save the file - project_dataframe.to.csv(“ProjectData.csv”, index=false) and to load it - Project = pd.read_csv(“ProjectData.csv”) 
Same as all the other tasks are performed using different different codes.
